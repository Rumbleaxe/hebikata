# 🐍 HebiKata

> An interactive Python learning space based on the principles of **Karate Kata**, **spaced repetition**, and inspired by **Rustlings**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**HebiKata** is a hands-on Python training platform designed to help learners internalize Python fundamentals and idioms through:

- 🧠 **Deliberate practice** via micro-exercises (katas)
- 🔁 **Spaced repetition** to reinforce long-term memory
- 🧪 **Instant feedback** to promote active learning
- 🎛️ **Interactive UI** powered by Streamlit

It's built as a personal open-source learning portfolio by [John Lazaridis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioannislazaridis/), aiming to democratize Python education while showcasing pedagogical and MLOps design.

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- 📦 Modular, YAML-defined katas with starter code, tests, and hints
- 🧮 Built-in spaced repetition engine (SM-2)
- 🖋️ Streamlit-based interactive UI with editor, output, and guidance
- 🧑‍🏫 Authoring tools for creating new kata modules
- 🗃️ Local or GitHub-based user progress tracking
